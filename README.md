# Things To Taskwarrior

**This script is rough and mostly for hacker/developers to play with.**

To run:

```bash
osascript things-to-taskwarrior.js
```

You'll probably be prompted to give your terminal permission to run
automations. There is screen-scraping to pull out checklists out of To-dos, you
can comment out that code if you don't care.
